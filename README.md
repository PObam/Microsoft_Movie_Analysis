#### Data Science Project, April 2023
#### By *Peggy Obam*
## Introduction 
This is an evaluation of different movie information aimed at guiding executive decision-making for Microsoft's hypothetical new movie studio. The analysis offers practical recommendations on the kinds of films the studio should prioritize making in order to achieve the highest possible box office success. The primary findings indicate that box office revenues are linked to genre, duration, and rating. By utilizing this analysis, Microsoft can generate successful films and establish its new studio as a profitable and competitive entity within the film industry
## Business problem
Microsoft has noticed that major companies are producing unique video content and they are interested in joining the trend. They have concluded to launch a novel movie production studio. However, they lack knowledge in film-making. My task is to investigate the types of movies that are presently performing well at the box office. Afterward, I will interpret the results into useful information that can assist the leader of Microsoft's new movie studio in determining the type of movies to generate
## Objectives
* To determine if there is any correlation between production budget and profit of a movie 
* To determine which movie title has the highest total gross 
* To determine which genre of movie has the highest rating 
* To determine which movie titles are the most profitable
## Data exploration
This analysis will make use of different movie information for different movie data sets including;
im.db(movie_basics and movie_ratings)
bom.movie_gross.csv
tn.movie.budgets.csv
I explored factors such as genres, production budget vs profit, movie titles to see Microsoft can generate successful films and establish a studio that will not only be profitable but also competitive

## Data analysis
1. Is there any correlatin between production budget and the profit a movie makes?

The graph shows a weak positive correlation between production budget and profit

2. Which movie title has the highest total gross?

Its important for a stuido to consideer both domestic and foreign markets if it has to fully utilize on its profits

3.Which genre of movie has the highest rating?

Most movie industries produce movies in genres with the highest rating. Hence its important to consider this in order to have a profitable business

4.what are the most profitable movie titles?

The team can focus on profitable movie titles and see what made them successful


## conclusion 
In conclusion, the scatter plot analysis indicates a weak positive correlation between production_budget and profit, suggesting that investing more in a movie production does not guarantee high profits. 
It is also noteworthy that movies such as Toy Story, Alice In Wonderland(2010), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows have generated the highest total gross, while "Adventure, Animation, Comedy", and "Animation, Drama, History" are the most popular genres. Furthermore, Avatar and Avengers:Infinity War have proved to be the most profitable movies, while Dark Phoenix incurred losses.
## Recommendation
From this analysis,I would recommended Microsoft to consider factors beyond budget when deciding on movie production. Additionally, investing in popular genres such as "adventure, animation,comedy", among others, could lead to more significant profits. Finally, attention to detail and careful consideration of the target audience (according to the genre_ratings) is crucial in ensuring that a movie achieves commercial success
